The ACE Authority is lowering the elevation of the existing railroad tracks to eliminate at-grade rail crossings with adjacent roadways to improve safety and speed the movement of trains.  As part of their work, they have to relocate a portion of the Sanitation Districts? JO  A  Unit 1A San Jose Creek WRP Interceptor Trunk Sewer between manholes (MHs) A382 to A381.  This section of sewer consists of a 24-inch reinforced concrete pipe siphon under a concrete lined drainage channel known as the Rubio Wash.      In order to lower the railroad tracks that cross perpendicularly across the Rubio Wash, the ACE Authority also has to lower the entire drainage channel.  As such, the Sanitation Districts? sewer that is located under the drainage channel needs to be relocated.  In its final configuration, the Sanitation Districts? sewer will bridge over the drainage channel rather than going under it.  All work to modify the drainage channel and relocate the Sanitation Districts? sewer is being carried out by the ACE Authority.    The ACE Authority is currently in the midst of construction, including excavating portions of the concrete lined drainage channel and exposing the Sanitation Districts? sewer.  To allow surface water flows to continue to be conveyed through the construction site, the construction contractor installed a temporary flow conveyance system, consisting of an earthen dam and piping to convey drainage flows through the excavation area to where the concrete lined channel is still intact.      On Sept. 15, 2015, runoff from an overnight storm overwhelmed the temporary flow conveyance system, overtopping the earthen dam.  The uncontrolled storm flow then entered and undermined the construction area.

Extreme weather conditions in the area led to a voltage sag at 2330 in the 115 kV PGE power lines feeding the MWWTP. This created a current surge at the MWWTP and the uninterruptable power supply system (UPS) at the influent pump station switched to the battery backup system for power feed. One of the cells in the backup battery system failed so the UPS switched back to the PGE power, and the current surge in PGE?s supply lines tripped the breaker for the UPS.

With the generator charging system panel disconnected for repair, this caused a loss of communication with the stand by generator engine control module (ECM).  This loss of the ECM communication caused the generator to not operate during the power outage that occurred at 18:54.  The spill continued until crews brought a 150 KW portable generator and hooked it up the MCC panel to power up needed pump station equipment.
